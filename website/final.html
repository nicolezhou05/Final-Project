    <p>For this project, we used pygame, a python library not covered in class. Pygame is a necessity for this project as it provides all the basic essentials for creating a game. It allows for easy display of the game, such as monsters and players, and as well as controls triggered by the keyboard. Pygame also allows us to provide graphics, which is something very important for a game. ***(describe how you use pygame)***</p>
